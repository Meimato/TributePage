            His life
          </h2>
          <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li>
              <strong>1452</strong> Leonardo is born on 15 April 1452 at
              Anchiano, a small village near Vinci, not far from Florence. He is
              the illegitimate son of a notary, Ser Piero.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1460</strong> Leonardo and his step-mother move to
              Florence with his father, who wants the boy to commence his
              studies and then take up the career of a notary.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1464-1469</strong> He is introduced to one of Florence's
              best known artistic workshops, that of Andrea del Verrocchio:
              young Leonardo begins his apprenticeship and gradually becomes
              more and more familiar with the many secrets of the workshop. He
              meets such young painters like Sandro Botticelli, Domenico
              Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino and Lorenzo di Credi.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1472</strong> His name appears in the account book of the
              painters' confraternity, the Company of St. Luke: this means that
              he is working as painter in his own right. He attends academies,
              workshops and, above all, the Medici household, where he makes the
              acquaintance of many intellectuals, including the philosopher
              Marsilio Ficino.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1475</strong> Verrocchio gives Leonardo the assignment of
              completing the face of an angel on the large altarpiece depicting
              The baptism of Christ.. This first painting assignment was to be
              followed by others; meanwhile, Leonardo continues taking notes in
              his unmistakable hand-writing.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1482</strong> Leonardo moves to Milan probably on the
              advice of Lorenzo de' Medici. He carries to the court of Ludovico
              il Moro, "the Moor" a letter in which he offers his services as
              engineer, architect, sculptor, painter and even musician. He will
              also work as organizer of the most important court feasts.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1483</strong> Together with the brothers Evangelista and
              Giovan Ambrogio de' Predis, he signs a contract to decorate the
              altarpiece for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception in
              the church of S. Francesco Grande. The central painting will be
              the Virgin of the Rocks, synthesis between artistic research and
              observation of nature.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1488</strong> For Ludovico il Moro he starts his studies
              on the making of a great equestrian bronze monument representing
              Francesco Sforza, but he still needs "a master or two capable of
              doing such work".
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1487-90</strong> As ducal engineer, he collects additional
              payment for the project of the tiburio ("crossing tower") of Milan
              Cathedral, though he is not commissioned to build it. The project
              will be carried out by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo and Giovanni
              Dolcebuono.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1490</strong> He visits the cities of Vigevano and Pavia,
              where ho meets the senese engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini.
              He describes irrigation works of the countryside and projects the
              Sforzesca, a model farm for the Duke.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1495-1498</strong> He is working to one of his
              masterpieces: the Last Supper, in the refectory of the Dominican
              Monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1498</strong> He paints the Sala delle Asse in the Milano
              Castle with a fresco depicting densely flowered branches of 16
              trees entwined with a long golden string, joining dynastic
              celebration with the representing of nature in all its details.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1499</strong> The Sforza duchy falls under the control of
              the French armies, whereupon Leonardo abandons Milan, leaving
              undone the casting of the big bronze horse: his clay model remains
              in the main court of the Castle. He visits Mantua and Venice.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1500</strong> He returns to Florence, where he draws the
              cartoon depicting St. Anne, which is exposed in the church of
              Annunziata.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1502</strong> He enters the service of Cesare Borgia as a
              military engineer, moving frequently from Tuscany to Romagna and
              Marche between the cities of Piombino, Siena, Imola, Senigallia
              and Cesena, where he designs a large navigable canal up to the
              Porto Cesenatico.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1503</strong> He is again in Florence, where he is working
              together with the young Michelangelo in the decoration of the
              Salone dei Cinquecento at Palazzo Vecchio: he attends a mural
              painting, never completed, depicting the Battle of Anghiari.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1503-04</strong> He probably begins two of his most famous
              paintings, the Mona Lisa, portrait that will remain in Leonardo's
              workshop until his death, and the lost Leda, homage to the power
              of nature, preceded by numerous preparatory drawings.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1506-1515</strong> Leonardo is called back to Milan by
              Charles of Amboise, the new city governor, and the next year by
              the king of France Louis XII in person. For the next two years he
              divides his time between Milan and Florence.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1508-13</strong> He often visits the Adda river; he
              projects new canals and investigates the forces of nature,
              particularly water, for him among the sources of life.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1515-1516</strong> Leonardo moves to Rome on the
              invitation of Giuliano de Medici. He devotes himself to geometry
              and hydraulic engineering, projecting the drain of the Pontine
              marsches and surveying the port of Civitavecchia.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1515</strong> He visits the Sistine Chapel as soon as
              completed by Michelangelo. Some time later he finds himself in
              Bologna with Giuliano de' Medici and pope Leo X, to meet the new
              king of France, Francis I, who invites him to France to work for
              him.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1516</strong> He is first painter, engineer and architect
              to the King, moving to the Castle of Cloux, near Amboise, with his
              pupil and friend Francesco Melzi. He designs some irrigation
              channels and a new and impressive royal residence at Romarantin.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>1519</strong> Leonardo dies on 2 May at Cloux, and is
              buried after his will in the cloister of St. Florentin Church in
              Amboise. In his will, dated 23 April of the same year, Leonardo
              bequeaths all his manuscripts, drawings and various instruments to
              his favourite disciple, Francesco Melzi.
